Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> recently started supporting the Raspberry pi Pico board due to a lot of effort put in by [@runger1101001](https://github.com/runger1101001). The support is still in its initial stage but most of the PWM related features are already implemented.

<blockquote class="warning"> <p class="heading">BEWARE: limitations of the current implementation ⚠️</p>
Raspberry Pi Pico's ADC features are not sufficient for low-side current sensing, but inline current sensing is supported. Current sensing is recently developed, and not well tested.

## Arduino IDE support package
In order to use the Pico boards in the Arduino IDE please install the Arduino MBED OS RP2040 boards support package using Arduino IDE board manager.

If using windows you might have to do a bit of acrobatics with the USB driver, but the solution is reasonably fast and straight forward. Here is [the link](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#uploading-sketches) with a bit of info how to do it.

Here is quick video showing how to do it:
