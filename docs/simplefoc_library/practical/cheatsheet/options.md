# Options

<span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> has many options, and the following tables summarize the important ones, collected in one convenient place for your immediate reference.

## Driver Options

Driver options are set before calling `driver.init()`, and normally never changed after intialization.

Option | Default value | Supported on | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
driver.pwm_frequency | depends on MCU | BLDC, Stepper | PWM frequency, in Hz
driver.voltage_power_supply | 12V | BLDC, Stepper | Power supply voltage in volts
driver.voltage_limit | NOT SET | BLDC, Stepper | Hard limit on output voltage, in volts. Effectively limits PWM duty cycle proportionally to power supply voltage.
driver.intialized | | BLDC, Stepper | Read-only. true if initialized successfully, false otherwise
driver.enable_active_high | true | BLDC | If true, driver is enabled by writing '1' to enable pin. If false, driver is enabled by writing '0' to enable pin.
driver.dead_zone | 0.02 | BLDCDriver6PWM | Amount of dead-time for each pwm cycle, as a proportion of 100% duty cycle. A float in the range [0,1]. Values under 10% make sense.

## Motor Options

Option | Default value | Description
--- | --- | ---
motor.controller | MotionControlType::torque | Motion control mode
motor.torque_controller | TorqueControlType::voltage | Torque control mode
motor.motion_downsample | 0 | Set to values > 1 to reduce how often move() is executed compared to loopFOC(). On fast MCUs it makes sense to reduce how often move() gets called.
motor.phase_resistance | NOT SET | Motor phase resistance. If set, used to calculate current limits based on voltage limits. Value in Ohms.
motor.KV_rating | NOT SET | motor KV rating, RMS value. Can also be set via motor constructor, where you can specify KV in RPM/V.
motor.phase_inductance | NOT SET | motor inductance, in H. Units Henry. Can also be set via motor constructor.
motor.voltage_limit | 12V | Global voltage limit. Limits Q-axis voltage.
motor.current_limit | 2A | Global current limit. Limits Q-axis current.
motor.velocity_limit | 20rad/s | Global velocity limit. Value in rad/s.
motor.foc_modulation | FOCModulationType::SinePWM | FOC modulation mode.
motor.modulation_centered | 1 (true) | 1/True: centered modulation around driver.voltage_limit√∑2 or 0/False: pulled to 0
motor.sensor_offset | 0 | Offset of motor zero to sensor zero. Can be used to make position 0 take on a specific motor orientation. For user convenience. Value in rad.
motor.voltage_sensor_align | motor.voltage_limit | Limits voltage (and therefore current) during motor alignment. Value in Volts.
motor.velocity_index_search | NOT SET | Limits motor velocity during motor initialization. Give value in rad/s.
motor.zero_electric_angle | NOT SET | Needed for FOC control. Normally set during motor FOC initialization. If set before motor.initFOC(), measurement of zero electric angle is skipped during alignment.
motor.sensor_direction | NOT SET | Normally set during motor FOC initialization. Determines sensor direction vs positive motor direction (can be opposite, depending how you connect your motor cables). If set before motor.initFOC(), measurement of sensor's natural direction is skipped during alignment.
motor.motor_status | FOCMotorStatus::motor_uninitialized | Read-only. Tracks the motor initialization status. You can check it to see if initialization succeeded, calibration is complete, etc.

## PID Tuning Options

Option | Modes used | Description
--- | --- | ---
motor.PID_velocity.P | All closed loop modes | Velocity PID controller P value. Varies by situation. Typical values are 0.2 to 0.6, but could be quite different.
motor.PID_velocity.I | All closed loop modes | Velocity PID controller I value. Varies by situation. Typical values are 2.0 to 20.0, but could be quite different.
motor.PID_velocity.D | All closed loop modes | Velocity PID controller D value. Normally set to 0. Typical values are 0, or a very low value like 0.001.
motor.PID_velocity.ramp | All closed loop modes | Velocity PID controller maximum change. Typical value 1000.0, set lower to limit accelleration.
motor.PID_velocity.limit | All closed loop modes | Velocity PID controller output limit. Set to limit velocity to this maximum.
motor.P_angle.P | Closed loop position control | Angle P controller P value. Varies by situation. Typical values are 10.0 to 20.0, but could be quite different.
motor.LPF_velocity.Tf | All closed loop modes | Velocity low pass filter time constant. Values larger than 0, max 1.0. The lower the value, the slower the effect of velocity changes from the sensor.
motor.LPF_angle.Tf | All closed loop modes | Angle low pass filter time constant. Values larger than 0, max 1.0. The lower the value, the slower the effect of angle changes from the sensor.
motor.PID_current_q.P | Torque current control | Q-Axis current controller P value.
motor.PID_current_q.I | Torque current control | Q-Axis current controller I value.
motor.PID_current_q.D | Torque current control | Q-Axis current controller D value.
motor.PID_current_q.ramp | Torque current control | Q-Axis current controller maximum change.
motor.PID_current_q.limit | Torque current control | Q-Axis current controller output limit.
motor.PID_current_d.P | Torque current control | D-Axis current controller P value.
motor.PID_current_d.I | Torque current control | D-Axis current controller I value.
motor.PID_current_d.D | Torque current control | D-Axis current controller D value.
motor.PID_current_d.ramp | Torque current control | D-Axis current controller maximum change.
motor.PID_current_d.limit | Torque current control | D-Axis current controller output limit.
motor.LPF_current_q.Tf | Torque current control | Q-Axis current low pass filter time constant.
motor.LPF_current_d.Tf | Torque current control | D-Axis current low pass filter time constant.
