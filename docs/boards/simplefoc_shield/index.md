This is a project of designing and controlling the reaction wheel inverted pendulum based entirely on Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> and <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield</span>

This is a very fun project in many ways, and it is intended:
- Students in search for a good testing platform for their advanced algorithms
- Everyone with a bit of free time and a motivation to create something cool :D

For full documentation of necessary components, design choices and the code please visit the [project docs](simplefoc_pendulum).


## Project example : Steer by wire - bidirectional haptic control examples

This video demonstrates <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield</span> support for stacking with Arduino UNO and STM32 Nucleo-64 board. As well as support for different sensors magnetic and encoders with relatively large precision span.

The control algorithms implemented in this project are :
- **Steer by wire** (force feedback): two motors with virtually coupled positions
- **Interactive gauge** (haptic velocity control): two motors with virtually coupled position and velocity


For full documentation of the projects setup and the code please visit the [project docs](haptics_examples).
