<span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Mini</span> is a small-package, low-cost, modular and user-friendly driver for running gimbal BLDC motors with FOC algorithm. As for the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shields</span>, the main motivation of this board is to make using low-power BLDC motors in hobby applications more accessible.
The main goals of this board however are:

- Produce a small package BLDC driver that still has all the features of the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield </span>v1
- Make it in away to be a minimal working example for users that are interested to build their own boards based on the DRV8313 chip.
- Make it as cheap as possible.
- Use only long-term (as of mid 2022) available components.
- Finally, the goal of this board is to provide a modular and simple setup for controlling gimbal motors (up to 3Amps) using FOC control and enable fast prototyping and full exploitation of their capabilities.

This board in combination with the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> will give you a simple and intuitive way to control the BLDC motors' current, torque, velocity and position. And this board can be used as a drop in replacement for the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield</span> v1.

### Release log

Release | Date | Description
--- | --- | ---
v1.1 | 2024-04 | A quick iteration with a few changes:<br> 1. Aligned motor output header with the input header so that it can be stacked in the protoboard<br>2. Input header updated to be easier to use with arduino UNO, nucleos, but also with qtpy...<br> - Changed the order of the IN1,IN2,IN3 and EN:<br> - Added an additional GND pin <br>
v1.0 | 2022-04 | Initial release

## Project example : Reaction wheel inverted pendulum
<iframe class="youtube"  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ih-izQyXJCI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
This is a project of designing and controlling the reaction wheel inverted pendulum based entirely on Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> and <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield</span>

This is a very fun project in many ways, and it is intended:
- Students in search for a good testing platform for their advanced algorithms
- Everyone with a bit of free time and a motivation to create something cool :D

For full documentation of necessary components, design choices and the code please visit the [project docs](simplefoc_pendulum).

## Project example : Steer by wire - bidirectional haptic control examples 
<iframe class="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xTlv1rPEqv4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This video demonstrates <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield</span> support for stacking with Arduino UNO and STM32 Nucleo-64 board. As well as support for different sensors magnetic and encoders with relatively large precision span.

The control algorithms implemented in this project are :
- **Steer by wire** (force feedback): two motors with virtually coupled positions
- **Interactive gauge** (haptic velocity control): two motors with virtually coupled position and velocity
