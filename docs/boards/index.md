# <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span> Boards</span>

One of the goals of the  <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>project</span> is to develop low-cost easy to use BLDC driver boards compatible with the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span>and completely open source! Therefore, <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span></span> team members have developed a set of boards, designed specifically for ease of use, to help you kickstart your FOC journey. In addition to being easy to use, the goal of these boards is serve as a reference design for the community to build upon. And finally, even though some of these boards are available in our [shop](https://www.simplefoc.com/shop), our docs provide a lot of documentation and step-by-step guides on how to fabricate the boards yourself.


There two main formats of the official drivers boards developed by the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span></span> team:

- <span class="simple">Shield</span> form factor: These boards are designed to be compatible with the Arduino ecosystem and are intended to be used with the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> and the Arduino IDE. They are designed to be easy to use and are intended for low to mid power applications.

In addition to the official boards, there are many other boards compatible with <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span>  that you can explore, see the [docs](supported_hardware). Additionally, some other cool hardware designs have been proposed by the community. Check out our [community forum](https://community.simplefoc.com/) for more info.



## Boards in the <span class="simple">Shield</span> form factor

These boards are designed to be compatible with the Arduino UNO R3 headers, enabling an easy to start experience with the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> and the Arduino IDE. The boards can be used with any board with the standard Arduino headers, such as the Arduino MEGA, STM32 Nucleo boards, Adafruit Metro, ESP32 D1 R3, Arduino UNO R4 and many others. This format enables users to easily exchange the microcontrollers and find the best solution for their application. The boards are fully open-source and the fabrication files are available in the respective repositories, as well as detailed guides on how to fabricate the boards yourself. The boards are additionally available in the [shop](https://www.simplefoc.com/shop) for those who prefer to buy them, as well as on other mainstream platforms like Aliexpress and Ebay (no relation to the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>project</span>).

### <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span> <b>Power</b>Shield</span> <small>v0.2</small> <small>‚ö†Ô∏è<i>( development abandoned )</i></small>

A powerful arduino shield for running BLDC motors using the FOC algorithm. This board is based on the [BTN8982](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-BTN8982TA-DS-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=db3a30433fa9412f013fbe32289b7c17) half bridges and can support currents up to 30 Amps continuos and 50Amps peak. Making it a board that can run virtually any BLDC motor.

<blockquote class="warning" markdown="1">
<p class="heading"> ‚ö†Ô∏è BEWARE: BTN8982/IFX007T performance issues</p>
BTN8982 and IFX007T drivers have been designed for DC motors and are based on old H-bridge technology. They have very long mosfet rise time (multiple microseconds) which in many cases presents a considerable part of the PWM duty cycle. When running the BLDC motors, precise PWM duty cycle setting is crucial for smooth and efficient operation. Therefore these drivers will not be able to provide very smooth operation on high frequency PWM (above 15kHz).  Read more about it in the community thread: [link](https://community.simplefoc.com/t/simplefoc-powershield/582).<br>
This performance constraint is the main reason why the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span> <b>Power</b>Shield</span> project has for now been put on hold, and although these boards are available through Aliexpress and some other platforms, they will not be available through simplefoc.com. 
<br><br>

This does not mean that the board itself is not functional or that it will not work in your project though. It is still one of the cheapest (simplest) solutions out there for mid to high power BLDC control and with proper tuning of control loops you will still be able to get some good results with it.
